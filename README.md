# message_counter
Python program to scrape data's html archive and produce pretty plots. For older formatting of facebook repositories, cerca 2015.

See fb_message_counter repository. This one is outdated. I wrote this program for the facebook data I downloaded back in 2015. Then when I downloaded my current data (2019), I discovered that facebook had changed how they stored and represente the data so I had to re-write everything.
